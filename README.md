# Validation

Temp repo for a validation library in Elixir inspired by [dry-validation](http://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-validation/).

The name is probably also temporary.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add `validation` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:validation, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```

  2. Ensure `validation` is started before your application:

    ```elixir
    def application do
      [applications: [:validation]]
    end
    ```
